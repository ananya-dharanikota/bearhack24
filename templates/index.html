Users may start searching aimlessly for hours on end, usually ending up with more questions than they began with. Our simple survey will allow users to find possible diagnoses based on their symptoms. Our goal is to aid users through the research process by simplifying their options, and offering straightforward and digestible information. We also provide images to compare with the users condition to further the researching process. We advise all users to seek medical attention and use this website as a research tool, not to receive a final diagnosis

Both students are Computer Science majors who have peaked interests in UI/UX and in web development. Their goal is to expand their knowledge in the  Computer Science World by learning more at hackathons and through each other. <br/><br/>Bryan and Vincent are two freshmen from UCI who came to explore the possibilities and opportunities that hackathons provide. Their knowledge in data bases and AI training allowed for doors to open to endless possibilities in development.<br/><br/>The two groups got together in Bear Hack to develop one who project for a dermatology analysis. Our goal is to help those who want to learn more about their condition with a clear lens.</div>
